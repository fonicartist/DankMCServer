2016-05-03 01:04:57 [WARNING] The server will make no attempt to authenticate usernames. Beware.
2016-05-03 01:04:57 [WARNING] While this makes the game possible to play without internet access, it also opens up the ability for hackers to connect with any username they choose.
2016-05-03 01:04:57 [WARNING] To change this, set "online-mode" to "true" in the server.properties file.

2016-05-09 12:42:44 [INFO] <Divineforby> well theres an internal buffer
2016-05-09 12:42:56 [INFO] <Divineforby> so we'll see if it produces energy
2016-05-09 12:42:59 [INFO] <Divineforby> once the buffer is full
2016-05-09 12:43:08 [INFO] <BladeSaurus> alright
2016-05-09 12:46:40 [INFO] <BladeSaurus> energy is being produced
